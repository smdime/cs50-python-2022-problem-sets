# Dice Game
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/AGBE7-RQHgU>
#### Description:
This is a game I often use to make my choices easy to make. I often use a two 20-sided dice. It is like having an 8-ball. Therefore, I created this program to share this experience.

The user is first asked to share their question. Then, they are asked to input their prefered number of dice and preferred number of sides. Upon hitting enter, the code will tell them the number of dice with the number of sides they have chosen, as well the total amount of the rolled dice. They will also be told if it's a yes or no.

Here I used the random() function to get the random number of dice rolled, as well as a random list of yes or no answers. I also used a sum() function to get the total number of the dice rolled.
